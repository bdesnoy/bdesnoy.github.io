Collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence .
Obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque .
Most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement .
McKay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .
A characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie .
A somewhat disappointing and meandering saga .
The screenplay , co-written by director Imogen Kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .
Each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time .
The laughs are as rare as snake foo yung .
Mattei so completely loses himself to the film 's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , Love in the Time of Money .

But first , you have to give the audience a reason to want to put for that effort
Been there , done that ... a thousand times already , and better .
What 's most offensive is n't the waste of a good cast , but the film 's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism .

While Serving Sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest Austin Powers extravaganza , there 's nothing here to match that movie 's intermittent moments of inspiration .
As with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else .

Shafer 's feature does n't offer much in terms of plot or acting .

Sheridan is painfully bad , a fourth-rate Jim Carrey who does n't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb .
Presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable .
Was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ?
I found it slow , predictable and not very amusing .
The fourth in a series that I 'll bet most parents had thought -- hoped !
Its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary .
more precious than perspicacious

A reworking of Die Hard and Cliffhanger but it 's nowhere near as exciting as either .
Suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness .
A film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity .
Fessenden continues to do interesting work , and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget .
Too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility .
Visually exciting sci-fi film which suffers from a lackluster screenplay .
While Hollywood Ending has its share of belly laughs -LRB- including a knockout of a closing line -RRB- , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity .
