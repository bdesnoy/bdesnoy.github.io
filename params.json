{"name":"Brian Desnoyers' Projects","tagline":"","body":"## Welcome to my portfolio\r\nHere I post a variety of simple projects and assignments I have worked on, listed by type.\r\n\r\n### [Space Invaders Game (Java)](https://github.com/bdesnoy/bdesnoy.github.io/tree/master/space_invaders)\r\nThis is a clone of the Space Invaders game I built in Java with a partner as part of the Fundamentals of Computer Science 2 Honors course at Northeastern University.\r\n\r\n### [Algorithm to Maximize Employee Influence (Python)](https://github.com/bdesnoy/bdesnoy.github.io/tree/master/employee_influence_algorithm)\r\nThis is a program that finds the optimum employees to influence in a company to spread propaganda within a company, as described in the problem description. The program is written in Python and was written as part of coursework for the Algorithms and Data Structures course at Northeastern University. A greedy algorithm was used to find the solution, as described in the Readme.pdf file. The list of employees was maintained in a priority queue implementation to ensure that it could process a list of ~800,000 employees in under one minute.\r\n\r\n### [Logo Design for LAUNCH Program (Inkscape / Logo Design)](https://github.com/bdesnoy/bdesnoy.github.io/tree/master/launch_logo)\r\nThis is a logo I designed for a new combined athletic and tutoring program for Boston Public High School students, titled Launch.\r\n\r\n### [Biostatistics Assignment (R / LaTeX for Typesetting)](https://github.com/bdesnoy/bdesnoy.github.io/tree/master/biostatistics_assignment)\r\nThis is an example of an analysis of biological data using the R programming language as part of a Biostatistics course at Northeastern University. The assignment looked at Environmental forcing in Eastern Boundary Current Systems and Temporal trends in upwelling and primary production.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
